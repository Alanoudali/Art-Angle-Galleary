     <p>John Singer Sargent
        Claude Monet Painting by the Edge of a Wood ?1885<br>
        Sargent first met Monet in 1876, but the two artists were closest ten years later.
         It was probably in 1885 that they painted together at Giverny, near Paris.
          Sargent admired the way that Monet worked out of doors, and imitated some of his subjects and methods in sketches such as this. It is characteristic of Sargent to give a human view of Monet's practice and of the patience of his wife,
           who sits behind him. When he settled in London in 1885 Sargent was initially viewed as avant-garde, but came to be the greatest society portraitist of his day.</p>

     <p>Camille Pissarro The Pork Butcher 1883<br>
        Like 'The Little Country Maid', 
        this painting was executed while the artist lived near Pontoise, north-west of Paris. 
        During the 1880s he became interested in painting rural market scenes, several of which were based on the markets at Pontoise and its neighbouring villages.
         Such subjects allowed Pissarro to combine the study of the human figure with depictions of outdoor scenes of everyday rural life. Although he wrote to his son Lucien that he wished the painting to have a 'certain naive freshness',
          hence the light and informal brushstrokes, the central figure of the 'charcutière' was painted from the model and the pose carefully studied.</p>

     <p>Claude Monet Poplars on the Epte 1891<br>
        In the summer of 1891 Monet learned that a row of poplars on the river Epte,
         near to his home at Giverny, were to be felled. Monet paid for them to be left standing long enough for him to paint them. 
         In all he executed twenty-three paintings of this scene, and exhibited a group of them together in 1892. Eleven of these show this same view at different times of day and in different weather conditions. 
         A particularly marked feature of this work is its combination of a strong surface pattern, emphasised by vigorous brushwork, and the suggestion of pictorial depth conveyed by the continuous zig-zag of trees leading back into the distance.</p>

     <p>Camille Pissarro The Little Country Maid 1882<br>
        This domestic interior depicts the dining room in Pissarro's house at Osny,
         near Pontoise in the French countryside not far from Paris. The child shown sitting at the table is the artist's fourth son, Ludovic Rodolphe.
          Pissarro spent much of his life near Pontoise and several of his paintings depict the surrounding landscape and its inhabitants. In this picture he used the typical Impressionist device of cutting off objects at the edges of the painting,
           such as the table, chairs and the prints on the wall, in order to give the composition a sense of informality and immediacy. The small, feathery brushstrokes prefigure Pissarro's later Neo-Impressionist or Divisionist paintings.</p>

     <p>Berthe Morisot Girl on a Divan c.1885 <br>
     The artist's grandson Denis Rouart writes (9 October 1969): 
     'This painting was sold by my mother direct to Vollard a long time ago, possibly during the 1914-18 war, possibly before, or shortly after. The studio stamp was put on it by my mother herself.
'The woman represented is certainly a model, if not a professional one, at least one who sat now and then for payment. She is not a relation or a friend. However, my mother did not know her name</p>

     <p>Philip Wilson Steer
      Girls Running, Walberswick Pier 1888–94<br>
     Steer made many visits to Walberswick in Suffolk, 
     where he had friends. He completed a number of paintings of the beach there that are among the most authentically Impressionist works produced in Britain.
      Here he captures the rich warmth of late afternoon sunlight but, unlike the French Impressionist Monet, he was just as interested in the figures as in their setting. Steer has reworked the dashed, broken colour of the paint surface extensively. The two girls were originally holding hands, and in their shadow they still are. This kind of picture was seen as uncompromisingly avant-garde. 
      One critic in 1892 even described such works at the New English Art Club exhibition as 'evil'.</p>
